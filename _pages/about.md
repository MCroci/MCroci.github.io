<h1 align="center"> Hi! I'm Michele Croci</h1>
<h6 align="center"> I am a researcher at the Department of Sustainable Crop Production at Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. I graduated in Agricultural Sciences and Technologies from the same university, where I also earned my PhD at the AGRISYSTEM PhD School, focusing on the agri-food system. My research mainly revolves around the analysis of remote sensing data for optimal crop and land management. </h6>

I specialize in using innovative technologies such as machine learning and multispectral imagery to develop advanced solutions for precision agriculture and sustainable resource management. My work spans high-throughput phenotyping, dynamic yield prediction, and agrivoltaic system modeling. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Research Center (CRAST) and a guest scientist at the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) in Germany.

Over the years, I have been actively involved in several impactful research projects, including **Mo.Re Farming**, aimed at promoting site-specific management techniques, and **Nutrivigna**, which focuses on improving vineyard nutrient efficiency while reducing environmental impact. Other key projects include **ClieNFarms**, supporting climate-neutral farming solutions, and **GRACE BBI**, dedicated to enhancing bioeconomy crops like miscanthus and hemp on marginal lands.

I am passionate about combining innovation and sustainability to tackle global challenges in agriculture. My scientific publications reflect my commitment to advancing the field, covering topics like early crop classification, biostimulant evaluation, and the integration of remote sensing for improved agricultural practices.

In addition to my research, I am proficient in programming languages such as R and Python, as well as advanced GIS tools like QGIS and OrfeoToolBox. I firmly believe that remote sensing and data-driven solutions are key to transforming agriculture into a more sustainable and resilient sector
